# Summary
[summary]: #summary

We want to have a well-defined API signing transactions to be sent to NEAR protocol via a wallet.
The API needs to support multiple transactions, including but not limited to:
- adding access keys to account
- sending tokens to other accounts
- composite transactions that contain several sub-transactions of potentially different types

In order to support this, we want a generic API for signing arbitrary transactions in the wallet.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

We want to support multiple wallet implementations, including those by third party developers. We also want to support multiple "styles" of wallets. E.g. web wallets, hardware wallets, browser extensions.
Any specific app may prefer to work with a specific wallet that best suits their use case (security requirements, usability, theme, UX, etc), so there must be a way to configure the app easily to use a particular wallet implementation. We also want a flexible system that allows adding new types of
transactions easily.

## Sign transaction with wallet.

App requests wallet to sign transaction by open following URL in browser:
{configurablewalleturl}/?transaction={transactiondata}
configurablewalleturl is a url prefix that can be specified when creating a NEAR connection using nearlib.
transactiondata transaction object serialized as a url encoded json string, which contains all the data that's necessary to actually process this transaction.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks
Not supporting multiple wallets would make the system a lot simpler, but is very detrimental to end user experience.

# Rationale and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

The url scheme that is live right now is the following, supporting a login operation:
{configurablewalleturl}/login/?public_key={public_key}&contract_id={contract_id}&success_url={success_url}&failure_url={failure_url}&title={title}
- contract_id param is the id of the contract
- success_url param is the url that the wallet will redirect to on success
- failure_url param is the url that the wallet will redirect to on failure
- title param is going to be deprecated soon. It is the human readable title of the app that is making the request (may need to be localized). This data should be available from contract metadata soon (please see contract metadata NEP)

Wallet creates and signs the addKey transaction directly. It appends the following parameters to the success_url
?account_id={account_id}&public_key={public_key}

The main drawback of this design is the difficulty of adding new transaction types. Nearlib code to be updated to add a new urlpath (e.g. /sign/, /send_money/), and additional url params may need to be added to the scheme. Also, a composite transaction type (transaction consisting of multiple sub-transactions) may be too difficult to implement using this approach.

# Unresolved questions

- Does the wallet always send the transaction directly, or do we need to support a use case of generating a signature and returning it back to the app?
